            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to embody Big Dog Energy: strength to protect pups who need a home,
                bravery to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves, and love for fun 
                and spreading joy.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>B.D.E. was founded in 2018 - just four friends and one big dream of caring for dogs
                in need and enriching the lives of homes that need a new friend. Now, two years 
                later, we've rescued over 1,000 dogs! Each day is hard work - unfortunately, there
                are so many dogs that need help in our city. But with the help of our dedicated
                team and the support of our community, we've been happily able to help out so many
                pups in need, and so many more to come! Dogs are love, dogs are life, dogs are everything.
