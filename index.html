                    <p style="color: #FAF3F6; font-family: 'Roboto';">In 2017, Bella was found under a bridge covered in sewer water in Boston, MA. When we found her,
                        she was covered in bruises, scratch marks and had swollen ankles. Bella fell victim to 
                        domestic abuse and showed signs of malnourishment. She had a long journey ahead for her 
                        physical and mental recovery. <br/> <br/>
                        One Friday afternoon, the O'Reilly family visited our shelter, hoping to rescue a young/middle-aged 
                        dog. They met Bella and instantly fell in love with her sweet face and bubbly personality. At that
                        point, Bella had completed her three months of therapy and was ready to join her new family. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Since that Friday afternoon, Bella has been a lovely addition to the O'Reilley family for the past three years.
                        She loves playing in the New England snow and snuggles with the kids during their weekly Harry Potter
                        movie marathons. Bella is happy, healthy, and safe â€” everything we could hope for.
